Software:
The software used for this project was RStudio Version 1.1.463 or higher in conjunction with the R Console 3.6.2 GUI 1.70 El Capitan build (7735).

Project Description:
This project entailed combining 4 machine learning algorithms/techniques for a report to predict a successful shot and successful won game from an NBA dataset.
My portion of the project dealt with SVM analysis, which is outlined in my code provided for the master code.
The report then combines all of our different machine learning and compares the highest accuracies and lowest accuracies. 
There are also useful visualizations provided, such as in my R code some ROC threshold plotting to illustrate how good the model is.
